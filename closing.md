# Closing Remarks

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank pancake for making radare2 and keeping it free and open source for now more than 10 years!

I would also like to thank anyone who has contributed in any way, be it code, documentation or tshirts and coffee mugs to making and keeping this project alive.

## Where to next?

Read some task writeups by people who use radare2, such as [Julien Voisin](https://dustri.org/) and [Jeffrey Crowell](http://crowell.github.io/), and always check out the radare2 official [blog](http://radare.today/) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/radareorg).

Then, practice what you have learned on reversing and exploit challenges that are out in the wild.
